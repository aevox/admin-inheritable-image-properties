==========================================
inheritable admin image properties
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/inheritable-admin-image-properties

Make some image properties inheritable even though the user does not have the
credentials to create them.

Problem description
===================

An image in glance can have custom properties that have CRUD rules.
When snapshotting or shelving an instance nova creates a new image in glance
using the user credentials. If the user does not have the rights to create a
custom property he is not able to create or shelve an instance.

Use Cases
----------

A cloud-administrator wants to store license-cost properties on a per-image
basis (like how much to charge per hour per cpu). This property can be
protected by role, but a cloud owner will want this property to be
automatically inherited to child images.

Another use case would be an administrator who wants to make operations on
instances depending on image propertiess. For example taging Windows instances
so they are run on a Windows hypervisor. We want this tag to be inherited to
run the snapshot on the same type of hypervisor. We do not want
the user to be able to change this property.

Project Priority
-----------------

None

Proposed change
===============

We propose to create the option "inheritable_admin_image_properties" containing
a list of properties.
After creation of the image when instance snapshotting or shelving, those
properties will be set by nova using its admin credentials.

Alternatives
------------

An alternative would be to create this functionality in glance. However we do
not think it is the way to do it since glance behaves like a simple object
store.
Inheritance is defined by custom properties which leads us back to our problem.

Performance Impact
------------------

With the option enabled there should be a performance impact as the request
will get a new token for elevated authentication.
