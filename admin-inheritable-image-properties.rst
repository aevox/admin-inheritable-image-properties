==========================================
inheritable admin image properties
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/inheritable-admin-image-properties

Make some image properties inheritable even though the user does not have the
credentials to create them.

Problem description
===================

When snapshotting or shelving an instance nova creates a new image in glance
using the user credentials. If the user does not have the rights to create a
custom property he is not able to make any of those operations.

Use Cases
----------

A cloud-administrator wants to store license-cost properties on a per-image
basis (like how much to charge per hour per cpu). This property can already be
protected by role, but a cloud owner will want this property to be
automatically inherited to child images.

Project Priority
-----------------

None

Proposed change
===============

We propose to create a new option in the nova conf file containing a list of
properties that should be inherited.
Upon instance snapshotting or shelving those properties will be set after
creation of the image by nova using its credentials.

Performance Impact

With the option enabled there should be a performance impact as the request
will get a new token for authentication.
